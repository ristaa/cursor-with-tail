# Cursor with tail
Simple canvas JS code which add some kind of a "tail" as a brush drawing behind cursor. 

Tail wil show on click and move (drag) and will follows cursor till cursor stop dragging. It's hardcoded and it's not easy script, so it's only usage would be for fast drag&drops of cursor for sliders.
